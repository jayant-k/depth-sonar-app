Initial step is to determine how to get to the surface of an interior of 3d space.
You are given a 3d volume as an array containing 1 for interior points in the array and 0 for exterior points.
You are a at an initial interior point.
Step A: Determine the center of gravity of all interior points
Step B: Move in the direction opposite to the direction from the initial interior point to the center
Step C: Repeat until you break out to the surface
